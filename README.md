# A litghtwieght Markdown to Html parser in Javascript

Ligthwieght parser for Markdown to Html, this is a small sideproject due to my own needs for now it only supports 

* h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p
* Code blocks

Support fore more features will happen when me myself need them.

There is a function written in src/parse.js that takes a string of markdown format and return a parsed textstring with html tags. There is also a example html file as index.html to demonstrate.
